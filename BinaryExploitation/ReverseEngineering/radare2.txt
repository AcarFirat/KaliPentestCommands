Radare2 is a powerful command line reversing tool.
Below are the most common commands you need for reversing a binary:

Open binary in debug mode: r2 -d <binary>

Analyze binary: aaa aaaa

List function names: afl

List strings in binary: izz

View disassembled functions: VV (interactive view) 
			     pdf 
			     pdf @ <function>	# pdf @ sym.main
			     V! (allows for setting of breakpoints and rewriting functions)

Rewrite an instruction (in debug mode + V!): move the target address to the top of the screen, then do 'wa <instruction>'	# works like vi, you need to do ':' first, then write 'wa <instruction>'
Set a breakpoint (in debug mode + V!)      : move the target address to the top of the screen, then do 'f2'

Run program: dc
Continue execution: s

Reopen in debug mode: ood

Rewrite strings in radare (must be same length to work properly): 
	
	Step 1: r2 -w <binary>
	Step 2: iz
	Step 3: w <string> @ <address>
