If you are doing binary exploitation and the target buffer size is too small for your whole payload, you will want to use an egghunter.


Find egg via mona in immunity debugger:

	# "w00tw00t" is a common string used as an egg (deadbeef aswell)
	syntax : !mona find -type asc -s "<egg>"
	example: !mona find -type asc -s "w00t"

Create egghunter via mona in immunity debugger:

	# If your egg is "w00tw00t", it suffices to only specify "w00t"
	syntax : !mona egg -t "<egg>"
	example: !mona egg -t "w00t"
