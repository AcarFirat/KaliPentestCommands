Port knocking is a security measure that keeps a port closed, until a prespecified amount of ports have been connected to in a certain sequence,
after which that closed port opens up.

Check out '/etc/iptables/rules.v4' and 'iptables -L'
Check out '/etc/init.d/knockd', '/etc/default/knockd' for config on the target box

syntax : for i in <ports>; do sudo nmap -Pn -p $i --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 <targetIP>; done
example: for i in 555 230 911 444; do sudo nmap -Pn -p $i --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 12.32.44.12; done
