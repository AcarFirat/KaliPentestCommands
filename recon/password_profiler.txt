cewl is a tool to scan websites for potential passwords:

	syntax : cewl <targetIP> -m <minWordLength> -w <outFile>
	example: cewl http://10.12.23.222 -m 6 -w passwords.txt

    syntax : cewl <targetIP> -d <spiderDepth> -m <minWordLength> -w <outFile> --with-numbers
    example: cewl http://ecorp.com -d 4 -m 3 -w passwords.txt --with-numbers

	# Get contents of a file and turn them to lowercase: tr A-Z a-z < <file> > <lowerCaseOutFile>

Use john the ripper to mutate the passwords and generate a wordlist:

	# You can edit the password mutation rules in /etc/john/john.conf
	# Add $[0-9] at the end of the section where it says '# Wordlist mode rules' 
	  and every password will be appended with one number	

	syntax : john --wordlist=<file> --rules --stdout > <outFile>
	example: john --wordlist=passwords.txt --rules --stdout > passDictionary.txt 

cupp/cupp3 is a tool that asks for input about a target (name, date of birth, family, partner, pets...) and 
generates a dictionary based on that information:

	example : cupp/cupp3 -i	-> starts interactive mode, enter details about the target
