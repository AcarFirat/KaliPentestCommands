Useful stuff to know for exploiting binaries using ROP chains

    Stack frame:
        A stack frame with stack canary protection looks like this:
                                                                <Bottom of memory, top of stack>

                                                                <ESP>
                                                                <Buffer 2>
                                                                <Buffer 1>
                                                                <Saved RBP>
                                                                <Stack canary>
                                                                <Return address>

                                                                <Top of memory, bottom of stack>

    x86 assembly:
        Arguments to functions are passed directly onto the stack in x86 architecture.

    x86_64 assembly:
        Arguments to functions are passed into RDI (arg1), RSI (arg2), RDX (arg3), RCX (arg4), R8 (arg5), R9 (arg6).
        If there are more than 6 arguments for a function call, the rest of the arguments are pushed directly on the stack.
