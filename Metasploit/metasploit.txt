Start up metasploit:

	Step 1: sudo service postgresql start
	Step 2: (sudo msfdb init)
	Step 3: msfconsole


General commands:
	Search stuff 		      : search <stuff>
	Search auxiliary modules      : show auxiliary
	Show info about module	      : info, show options	# set RHOSTS 10.10.14.86
	Set global variables	      : setg <option>		# setg LHOST 192.168.0.144

	auto-migrate to stable process: set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate
					# When running a client-side attack, the victim will most likely close the malicious file within seconds,
					  causing your shell to crash. By using auto-migrate, the shell will migrate to a stable process on the machine
					  so the shell won't die when its bearer dies.

Use the metasploit database:

	Check all the scanned hosts	   : hosts
	Run an nmap on all the hosts	   : db_nmap 10.12.12.1-255
	Check found open ports on the hosts: services -p 22
