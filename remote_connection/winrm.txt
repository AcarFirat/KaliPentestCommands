Connect to a Windows box via winrm (port 5985) by either directly accessing or port-forwarding the port:
If you want to use winrm with an ipv6 ip address, add the address to /etc/hosts and use that given domain name 
as parameter after -i for evil-winrm.


	Via program:

		Step 1: gem install evil-winrm
		Step 2: evil-winrm -i <targetIP> -u <victimUser> -p <victimPass>

	Via winrm.rb script with victim's user and password creds:

		See ./winrm.rb

	Via winrm.rb with victim user and key .pem file (extracted from cert)

		See ./winrm_cert.rb
