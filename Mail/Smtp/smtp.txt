Set up a simple smtp server with Python (https://muffinresearch.co.uk/fake-smtp-server-with-python/):

	syntax : python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer <localHost>:<localPort> (<remoteHost>:<remotePort>)
	example: python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25

	
	From the documentation:
	
	If localhost is not given, then `localhost' is used and if localport is not
	given then 8025 is used.  If remotehost is not given then `localhost' is used,
	and if remoteport is not given, then 25 is used.


Test to see if your simple smtp server actually works (do this while above python command is running):
	
	Step 1: nc localhost 25

	HELO host
	MAIL FROM: me@localhost.com
	250 Ok
	RCPT TO: test@localhost.com
	250 Ok
	DATA
	354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
	subject: Hello
	from: Me
	to: Test
	Python smtp server works!
	.
	250 Ok
	QUIT
	221 Bye
	Connection closed by foreign host.
