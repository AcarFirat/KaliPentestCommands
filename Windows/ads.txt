ADS = Alternate Data Streams
ADS is a way to hide data in files from the standard means of viewing files. To read ADS in a file via powershell, do the following:
(Copying these files over to linux might erase the ADS, because it's part of NTFS)
	
	# Powershell
	Step 1(victim): get-item <file> -stream *

	# Check the stream names if there are any -> <stream>

	Step 2(victim): get-content <file> -stream <stream>
