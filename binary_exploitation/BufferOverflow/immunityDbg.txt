Immunity debugger is used when you have to analyze a running process

Setting up immunity debugger:
	
	Step 1	: Run immunity as administrator
	Step 2	: File -> attach -> attach the process you need
	Step 3	: Press play to run the program (top left somewhere)
	Optional: Change appearance


Setting up mona (https://github.com/corelan/mona): 
	
	(from the github page)	
	Step 1  : Drag 'mona.py' into the 'PyCommands' folder inside the 'Immunity Debugger' application folder
		  (C:\Program Files\Immunity Inc\Immunity Debugger\PyCommands)

	Step 2  : Install Python 2.7.14 (or a higher 2.7.xx version) into c:\python27, thus overwriting the version
		  that was bundled with Immunity. This is needed to avoid TLS issues when trying to update mona.


Using immunity debugger:
	
	Place breakpoint: F2
	Follow expr 	: Click the right arrow pointing to the four vertical dots in the top bar (->:) and enter an address.


Using Mona:

	Get modules : !mona modules
	Find jmp ESP: Go to executable modules list (click the 'e' at the top bar)
	Search cmds : 'Right click assembly pane -> search for -> command/sequence of commands'
	Check perms : Go to modules list (click on the 'm' at the top bar)
	Find opcode : !mona find -s "<opcode>" -m <moduleName>		# example: !mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m slmfc.dll
