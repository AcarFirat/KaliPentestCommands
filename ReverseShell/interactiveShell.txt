When you get the reverse shell, you want a nice, interactive shell. We follow these steps to make this reality:

Step 1: python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'	or python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Step 2: do 'ctrl+z' to stop current shell and return to your own shell

Step 3: do 'stty raw -echo'

Step 4: type 'fg' to bring the stopped job (the reverse shell) back to foreground

Step 5: do 'export TERM=screen'

Step 6: you should have a nice, interactive shell now on the victim box

Step 7: to get back to normal input, either restart the terminal session or do 'stty cooked sane'
