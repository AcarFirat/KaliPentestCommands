Microsoft IIS has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized information disclosure by scanning web directories 
using the '~' character in a certain way to scan for file shortnames.

Using IIS-Shortname-Scanner (https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner), we can automate this process:

	syntax : java -jar iis_shortname_scanner.jar <showProgress> <threads> <url> > <outFile>
	example: java -jar iis_shortname_scanner.jar 2 20 http://vulnerable.org/admin/ > /root/iis_scan.txt

	If the result is something like ADM_PASS~1.txt, that means there's a file that could be adm_password.txt
	or adm_passwords1.txt, so it still takes some extra guessing/scanning to get the right files.
