Use sshuttle to tunnel to a network that is not reachable by your attacking pc via a compromised machine:

	syntax : sshuttle -r <victim>@<victimIP> <targetNetwork>
	example: sshuttle -r manager@10.24.3.3 10.22.22.0/24
	example: sshuttle -r manager@10.24.3.3 10.22.22.0/24 --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i /home/keys/manager.rsa'	# for when you need to use an RSA key to connect 
		 # 10.24.3.3 is a machine that we compromised, 10.22.22.0/24 is the network
		   we want to access on our attacking box through the compromised machine
