Ghidra is an open-source reverse engineering tool released by the NSA.

To get started on debugging a binary:

	Step 1: File -> New Project -> Choose directory and project name
	Step 2: File -> Import File -> Select the binary to disassemble
	Step 3: Doubleclick the file to start debugging

Rewrite (patch) instructions:
	# There is a bug in Ghidra, which causes a rewritten program to segfault when exported. Fix this by importing the binary
	  in raw format.

	Step 1: Find the desired function to rewrite
	Step 2: Right click the function (assembly code in middle screen) -> Patch instruction
	Step 3: Rewrite the instruction (for example: change JNZ LAB_000011f4 to JNZ LAB_000023df)
	Step 4: File -> Export Program
	Step 5: Choose format and output directory/name
	Step 6: Run the new program

Navigate to address:

	Step 1: Navigation -> Go to
